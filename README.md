# Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS)[^1^][1]

## Abstract
- **Challenge in Diversity**: Addresses the mismatch in cultural backgrounds between students and teachers, contributing to academic achievement gaps[^2^][2].
- **Innovative Tool**: Introduces T-TExTS, a knowledge graph to aid teachers in selecting culturally diverse texts aligned with educational standards.

## Introduction
- **Cultural Mismatch**: Highlights the increasing diversity in student demographics versus the stagnant teaching force and curriculum.
- **Importance of Text Selection**: Emphasizes the critical role of text selection in literacy education and its impact on diverse learners.

## Literature Review
- **Curriculum Diversification**: Discusses the need for curriculum diversification in English Language Arts classrooms to improve student achievement.
- **Barriers to Diversification**: Identifies barriers such as finances, resources, and political climate that hinder text diversification efforts.

## Methodology
- **KNARM Methodology**: Describes the use of KNARM methodology for creating a flexible and adaptable knowledge graph for T-TExTS[^3^][3].

## Result and Conclusion
- **T-TExTS Tool**: Details the creation of a teacher-focused tool using KNARM to model books with instructional and multicultural elements[^4^][4].

## Future Discussions
- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings**: Proposes future enhancements like Knowledge Graph Embeddings for improved text recommendations.
